2. Please upload the algorithm assigned to you into the "scheduling-algos" branch. Make sure that before pushing your code, always do a "git pull" first to get the latest changes in the branch. Once done copy and paste your java file into the folder and then commit your changes into the branch. After commiting do a "git push".
